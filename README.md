# Compiling / Running

Requires: [glfw3](http://www.glfw.org/download.html "glfw"), [ENet](http://enet.bespin.org/ "ENet")

Run `make` to compile and run `./server` or `./client` to play!

# ToDo

  - All :)
  - Check if it still compiles on linux
  - Check if it still compiles on mac
  - Finish the server
  - Write the client
  - Attempt to make the code look clean
    - fail :broken_heart:
